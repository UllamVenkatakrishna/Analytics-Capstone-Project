# Project Title: Citi Bike Trip Histories 

# Project Description

The project provides access to Citi Bike trip data for anyone to use. The data is available in downloadable files and includes information about individual bike rides. This allows people like developers, researchers, and artists to analyze the data to answer questions about how and when people use the bike-sharing system.

What's in the Data?
The data contains detailed information for each bike trip, such as:

When the trip started and ended

Where the trip started and ended (including station names and locations)

The type of bike used

Whether the rider was a member or a one-time user

The project also offers real-time data and monthly reports for a more complete picture of the system's operations.
